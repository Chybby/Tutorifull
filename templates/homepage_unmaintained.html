        Sometimes you miss out on enrolling in that class that's just
        perfect for you: late enough so you don't need 5 cups of coffee
        to survive it but early enough so you can still grab a kebab box
        from the Quad for lunch right afterwards. <br><br>Or maybe you just
        don't like climbing the Basser steps to get to your tute room.<br><br>
        With Tutorifull you can sign up to be alerted by email, SMS
        or Yo when a spot opens up in a full class.<br><br>
        Never settle for an 9am tute again.

        This tool is unmaintained. If you like the concept you could try asking
        CSESoc Webmin (or whatever they're called now) to see if they'd be
        interested in taking over running and maintaining it.
